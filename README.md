* [x] show a grey message counter in channels with messages you didn't read yet
* [x] on laptops and desktops, automatically put the user's cursor in the text input element when they enter a channel or a dm

* [x] parse youtube video urls and display them as embedded
* [x] keep the keyboard visible after you send a message on mobile
* [x] multi select emojis before closing emoji window
* [x] create a mini player for youtube videos so you can leave the channel and keep the video playing

* [ ] add sticky messages
* [ ] let channel creators blacklist posts and users (blacklists are enforced client side, so client software can optionally ignore them)

* [ ] investigate why new messages sometimes say they happened 12 months ago (this seems more prevalent on mobile)
* [ ] investigate why new messages don't always show up as the latest message in the sidebar
* [ ] add a "messages not read" delineating line if you go to a channel or a dm with fewer than 200 unread messages in it, separating the messages you read from the messages you didn't
* [ ] if a "messages not read" line exists when entering a channel or a dm containing unread messages, autoscroll to that instead of to the latest message
* [ ] fix the bug that makes stuff disappear below the fold when images and videos expand
* [ ] the anigma browser tab should show a notification when new messages arrive
* [ ] print the total messages that are in a channels in the channel about div
* [ ] if a user is not near the bottom of the chat log, don't scroll to the bottom when they open up the keyboard
* [ ] users who click or tap the back button should not close the app. They should go to the previous page
* [ ] users who go from a channel to a profile should have a button to go back to the channel. The button that seems most obvious currently takes them to the sidebar
